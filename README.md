# ZhehanZ NanoFolio

## Introduction

ZhehanZ NanoFolio is **a highly tailored student portfolio site template** built on the Astro framework.

Its design draws inspiration from [Astro Nano](https://github.com/markhorn-dev/astro-nano), with significant customization to better align with the unique needs of students.

The template is also equipped with built-in support for internationalization (i18n), offering seamless functionality in both Simplified Chinese and English.

NanoFolio inherits all of Astro Nano's strengths. It's still lightweight and loads increidbly fast with beautiful animations.

## Deployment

As many customizations are written directly in the code and not modifiable, the ZhehanZ NanoFolio is not yet ready for distribution.

**Please refrain from deploying this template in a production environment.** A production-ready version will be available in the near future.

## Development

Contributions to the template are welcome! Get started by creating a fork and starting your development server.

Identical to Astro Nano, all commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

Replace npm with your package manager of choice. `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, `bun`, etc
