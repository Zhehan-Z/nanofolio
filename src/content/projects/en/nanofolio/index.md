ZhehanZ NanoFolio is **a highly tailored student portfolio site template** built on the Astro framework.

Its design draws inspiration from [Astro Nano](https://github.com/markhorn-dev/astro-nano), with significant customization to better align with the unique needs of students.

The template is also equipped with built-in support for internationalization (i18n), offering seamless functionality in both Simplified Chinese and English.

NanoFolio inherits all of Astro Nano's strengths. It's still lightweight and loads increidbly fast with beautiful animations.

As many customizations are written directly in the code and not modifiable, the ZhehanZ NanoFolio is not yet ready for distribution.

**Please refrain from deploying this template in a production environment.** A production-ready version will be available in the near future.
